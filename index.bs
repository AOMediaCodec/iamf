# Introduction # {#introduction}

The <dfn noexport>IA sequence</dfn> is a bitstream to represent immersive audio for presentation on a wide range of devices in both dynamic streaming and offline applications. These applications include internet audio streaming, multicasting/broadcasting services, file download, gaming, communication, virtual and augmented reality, and others. In these applications, audio may be played back on a wide range of devices, e.g. headsets, mobile phones, tablets, TVs, sound bars, home theater systems and big screen.

The bitstream comprises a number of coded audio substreams and the metadata that describes how to decode, render and mix the substreams to generate an audio signal for playback. The bitstream format itself is codec-agnostic; any supported audio codec may be used to code the audio substreams.

The immersive audio media and format (<dfn noexport>IAMF</dfn>) is the model and format for immersive audio (IA).

The figure below shows the conceptual IAMF architecture.

<center><img src="images/Conceptual IAC Architecture.png"></center>
<center><figcaption>Conceptual IAMF Architecture</figcaption></center>

For a given input 3D audio,
- Pre-Processor generates Pre-Processed Audio and Codec Agnostic Metadata for immersive audio (IA).
- Audio Codec Enc generates Codec-Dependent Bitstream, which consists of the coded streams, coded from Pre-Processed Audio.
- File Packager generates IAMF File by encapsulating IA sequence, which consists of Codec-Dependent Bitstream and Codec Agnostic Metadata, into [[!ISOBMFF]] tracks.
- File Parser reconstructs IA sequence by decapsulating IAMF File.
- Audio Codec Dec outputs a decoded Pre-Processed Audio after decoding of Codec-Dependent Bitstream.
- Post-Processor outputs Immersive 3D Audio by using the decoded Pre-Processed Audio and Codec Agnostic Metadata.


The rest of this specification is formulated as follows:
- [[#overview]] describes the high level IA sequence architecture and introduces its components.
- [[#obu-syntax]] specifies the syntax and semantics of the top level IA components and detailed IA components.
- [[#profiles]] specifies the profiles for IA sequences and IA decoders.
- [[#standalone]] specifies the representation of a standalone IA sequence.
- [[#isobmff]] specifies the encapsulation of an IA sequence into [[!ISOBMFF]] tracks.
- [[#processing]] specifies how the IA sequence should be decoded to generatethe output immersive 3D audio.
- [[#iamfgeneration]] provides a guideline for generating the IA sequence.
- [[#iamfconsumption]] provides a guideline for consuming the IA sequence, for different use-cases.


# Overview # {#overview}

## IA sequence Components ## {#iab-components}

The IA sequence includes one or more audio elements, each of which consists of one or more audio substreams. The IA sequence further include mix presentations and parameters.

- <dfn noexport>Audio substream</dfn> is the actual audio signal, which may be encoded with any compatible audio codec.
- <dfn noexport>Audio element</dfn> is the 3D representation of the audio signals, and are constructed from one or more audio substreams and the metadata describing them. The audio substreams associated with one audio element use the same audio codec.
- <dfn noexport>Mix presentations</dfn> contain metadata that describe how the audio elements are rendered and mixed together for playback through physical loudspeakers or headphones. At any given time, only one mix presentation is used for playback. However, multiple mix presentations can be defined as alternatives to each other within the same IA sequence. Furthermore, the choice of which mix presentation to use at playback is left to the user. For example, multi-language support is implemented by defining different mix presentations, where the first mix describes the use of the audio element with English dialogue, and the second mix describes the use of the audio element with French dialogue.
- <dfn noexport>Parameters</dfn> are the values that are associated with the algorithms used for decoding, reconstructing, rendering and mixing. Parameters may change their values over time and may further be animated; for example, any changes in values may be smoothed over some time interval. Their rate of change is specific to its respective algorithm, and is independent of other algorithms and the frame rates associated with the audio substreams. As such, they may be viewed as a 1D signal that have different metadata specified for different time intervals.


The figure below shows the relationship between the audio substreams, audio elements and mix presentations and the processing flow to obtain the immersive audio playback.

<center><figcaption>Processing flow to decode, reconstruct, render and mix the audio signals for immersive audio playback.</figcaption></center>

## Use of OBU Syntax ## {#use-of-obu}

### Descriptors ### {#descriptors}

The descriptor OBUs contains all the information that is required to setup and configure the decoders, reconstruction algorithms, renderers and mixers.

- <dfn noexport>Magic Code OBU</dfn> indicates the start of a full IA sequence description, version and profile version.
- <dfn noexport>Codec Config OBU</dfn> describes information to set up a decoder for an audio substream.
- <dfn noexport>Audio Element OBU</dfn> describes information to combine one or more audio substreams to reconstruct an audio element.
- <dfn noexport>Mix Presentation OBU</dfn> describes information to render and mix one or more audio elements to generate the final audio output.

### Data ### {#data}

The data OBUs contain the actual time-varying data that is required in the generation of the final audio output.

The IA sequence supports the description of multiple audio substreams and algorithms, which may have different metadata update rates to each other. The update rate for the audio substreams and audio elements is governed by the frame rates of the audio codec used. Since a single bitstream may support multiple codecs, this may lead to multiple different frame rates. The algorithms for rendering and mixing may have parameters that update at different rates to each other and to the audio frame rates. Therefore, the IA sequence contains information to facilitate the synchronization of the different audio frames and parameters.

- <dfn noexport>Audio Frame OBU</dfn> provides the raw coded audio frame for an audio substream.
- <dfn noexport>Parameter Block OBU</dfn> provides the time-varying parameter values for an algorithm used in any of the decoding, reconstruction, rendering or mixing steps.
- <dfn noexport>Sync OBU</dfn> provides relative timestamp offsets to synchronize audio frames and parameter blocks.
- <dfn noexport>Temporal Delimiter OBU</dfn> identifies the temporal units.


The below figure shows the linking scheme among [=obu_id=]s in obu_header and ids in obu payload.

<center><img src="images/ID Linking Example.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;"></center>
<center><figcaption>ID Linking Scheme</figcaption></center>

In the above figure, 
- codec config obu is saying that there are two audio elements (audio_element_id = 11 and 12) which are coded by using the codec_config() in the obu.
	- The audio element having audio_element_id = 11 is linked to the audio element obu having audio_element_id = 11.
		- The audio element obu is saying that there are two substreams (substream_id = 31 and 32) which composing of this audio element.
			- The audio substream having substream_id = 31 is linked to the audio frame obus having id = 31.
			- The audio substream having substream_id = 32 is linked to the audio frame obus having id = 32.
		- The audio element obu is saying that there are one parameter block (parameter_id = 71) for demixing_info_parameter_data() which is applied to the audio element.
			- The parameter block having parameter_id = 71 is linked to the parameter block obu having parameter_id = 71.
		- IAMF decoders applies the parameter block to the audio substreams after decoding by substream decoders.
	- The audio element having audio_element_id = 12 is linked to the audio element obu having obu_id = 12.
		- The audio element obu is saying that there are one substream (substream_id = 33) which composing of this audio element. 
			- The audio substream having substream_id = 33 is linked to the audio frame obus having id = 33.
		- Substream decoder do decoding the substream.
- mix presentation obu is saying that there are two audio elements (audio_element_id = 11 and 12) which need to be mixed.
	- The audio element having audio_element_id = 11 and the audio element having audio_element_id = 12 are mixed after decoding each of them.
	- Then IAMF decoders may do process loudness and drc controls by using mix_loudness_info() and drc_config().		



# Open Bitstream Unit (OBU) Syntax and Semantics # {#obu-syntax}

## Top Level OBU Syntax and Semantics ## {#top-level-syntax}

The IA sequence uses the OBU syntax.

This section specifies the top-level OBU syntax elements and their semantics.

### Audio OBU Syntax and Semantics ### {#audio-obu}

<b>Syntax</b>

```
class audio_open_bitstream_unit() {
  obu_header();

  if (obu_type == OBU_IA_Magic_Code)
    magic_code_obu();
  else if (obu_type == OBU_IA_Codec_Config)
    codec_config_obu();
  else if (obu_type == OBU_IA_Audio_Element)
    audio_element_obu();
  else if (obu_type == OBU_IA_Mix_Presentation)
    mix_presentation_obu();
  else if (obu_type == OBU_IA_Parameter_Block)
    parameter_block_obu();
  else if (obu_type == OBU_IA_Temporal_Delimiter)
    temporal_delimiter_obu();
  else if (obu_type == OBU_IA_Sync)
    sync_obu();
  else if (obu_type == OBU_IA_Audio_Frame)
    audio_frame_obu_with_no_id();
  else if (obu_type >= 9 and <= 30)
    audio_frame_obu(obu_type - 9);
  else if (obu_type == 6 or 7)
    reserved_obu();

  byte_alignment():
}
```

<b>Semantics</b>

If the syntax element obu_type is equal to OBU_IA_Magic_Code, an ordered series of OBUs is presented to the decoding process as a string of bytes.

OBU data shall start on the first (most significant) bit and shall end on the last bit of the given bytes. The payload of an OBU shall lie between the first bit of the given bytes and the last bit before the first zero bit of the byte_alignment().


### OBU Header Syntax and Semantics ### {#obu-header}

<b>Syntax</b>

```
class obu_header() {
  unsigned int (5) obu_type;
  unsigned int (1) obu_redundant_copy;
  unsigned int (1) obu_trimming_status_flag;
  unsigned int (1) obu_extension_flag;
  leb128() obu_size;

  if (obu_trimming_status_flag) {
    leb128() num_samples_to_trim_at_end;
    leb128() num_samples_to_trim_at_start;
  }
  if (obu_extension_flag == 1)
    leb128() extension_header_size;
}
```

<b>Semantics</b>

OBUs are structured with a header and a payload.

<dfn noexport>obu_type</dfn> specifies the type of data structure contained in the OBU payload.

<pre class = "def">
obu_type: Name of obu_type
   0    : OBU_IA_Codec_Config
   1    : OBU_IA_Audio_Element
   2    : OBU_IA_Mix_Presentation
   3    : OBU_IA_Parameter_Block
   4    : OBU_IA_Temporal_Delimiter
   5    : OBU_IA_Sync
  6~7   : Reserved
   8    : OBU_IA_Audio_Frame
  9~30  : OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID0 to OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID21
   31   : OBU_IA_Magic_Code
</pre>

<dfn noexport>obu_redundant_copy</dfn> indicates whether this OBU is a redundant copy of the previous OBU in the IA sequence with the same obu_type. A value of 1 shall indicate that it is a redundant copy, while a value of 0 shall indicate that it is not.

It shall always be set to 0 for the following obu_type values:

- OBU_IA_Temporal_Delimiter
- OBU_IA_Sync
- OBU_IA_Audio_Frame
- OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID0 to OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID21

<dfn noexport>obu_trimming_status_flag</dfn> indicates whether this OBU has audio samples to be trimmed or not. If it is set to 1, the [=num_samples_to_trim_at_start=] and [=num_samples_to_trim_at_end=] fields shall be present.

<dfn noexport>obu_extension_flag</dfn> indicates whether the [=extension_header_size=] field shall be present. If it set to 0, the [=extension_header_size=] field shall not be present. Otherwise, the [=extension_header_size=] field shall be present.

This flag shall be set to 0 for the current version of the specification (i.e. [=version=] = 0). An IAMF-OBU parser which is conformant with the current version of the specification shall be able to parse this flag and [=extension_header_size=].

NOTE: A future version of specification may use this flag to specify an extension header field by setting [=obu_extension_flag=] = 1 and setting the size of extended header to [=extension_header_size=].

<dfn noexport>obu_size</dfn> shall indicate the size in bytes of the OBU not including the bytes within the obu_header of the preceding fields, i.e. obu_type, obu_redundant_copy, obu_trimming_status_flag and obu_extension_flag.

<dfn noexport>num_samples_to_trim_at_start</dfn> shall indicate the number of samples that needs to be trimmed from the start of the samples in this Audio Frame OBU. 

<dfn noexport>num_samples_to_trim_at_end</dfn> shall indicate the number of samples that needs to be trimmed from the end of the samples in this Audio Frame OBU.

<dfn noexport>extension_header_size</dfn> shall indicate the size in bytes of the extension header including this field.


### Byte Alignment Syntax and Semantics ### {#obu-bytealignment}

<b>Syntax</b>

```
class byte_alignment() {
  while (get_position() & 7)
    unsigned int (1) zero_bit;
}
```

<b>Semantics</b>

<dfn noexport>zero_bit</dfn> shall be equal to 0 and shall be inserted into the bitstream to align the bit position to a multiple of 8 bits.


### Reserved OBU Syntax and Semantics ### {#obu-reserved}

The reserved OBU allows the extension of this specification with additional OBU types in a way that allows IAMF-OBU parsers compliant to this version of specification to ignore them.


### Magic Code OBU Syntax and Semantics ### {#obu-magiccode}

This section specifies obu payload of OBU_IA_Magic_Code.

For this obu, the obu header (2 bytes) shall be set to 0xF006.

<b>Syntax</b>

```
class magic_code_obu() {
  unsigned int (32) ia_code;
  unsigned int (8) version;
  unsigned int (8) profile_version
}
```

<b>Semantics</b>

<dfn noexport>ia_code</dfn> shall be a ‘four-character code’ (4CC) to identify the start of the IA sequence. It shall be 'iamf'.

<dfn noexport>version</dfn> shall indicate the version of an IA sequence. It shall be set to 0 for this version of the specification. Implementations should treat IA sequences where the MSB four bits of the version number match that of a recognized specification as backwards compatible with that specification. That is, the version number can be split into "major" and "minor" version sub-fields, with changes to the minor sub-field (in the LSB four bits) signaling compatible changes. For example, an implementation of this specification should accept any stream with a version number of ’15’ or less, and should assume any stream with a version number ’16’ or
greater is incompatible.

<dfn noexport>profile_version</dfn> shall indicate the profile of an IA sequence. The MSB four bits shall indicate the profile of an IA sequence. Implementations should treat IA sequences where the MSB four bits of the version number match that of a recognized profile as backwards compatible with that specification. That is, the version number can be split into "profile major" and "profile minor" version sub-fields, with changes to the minor sub-field (in the LSB four bits) signaling compatible changes with the profile major version. The semantic of this field shall be only valid when the MSB four bits of [=version=] = 0.

### Codec Config OBU Syntax and Semantics ### {#obu-codecconfig}

This section specifies the OBU payload of OBU_IA_Codec_Config.

<b>Syntax</b>

```
class codec_config_obu() {
  leb128() codec_config_id;  
  codec_config();

### Mix Presentation OBU Syntax and Semantics ### {#obu-mixpresentation}

This section specifies the OBU payload of OBU_IA_Mix_Presentation.

The metadata in mix_presentation() specifies how to render, process and mix one or more audio elements, with details provided in [[#processing-mixpresentation]].

An IA sequence may have one or more mix presentations specified. The IA parser shall select the appropriate mix presentation to process according to the rules specified in [[#processing-mixpresentation-selection]].

A mix presentation may contain one or more sub-mixes. Common use-cases may specify only one sub-mix, which includes all rendered and processed audio elements used in the mix presentation. The use-case for specifying more than one sub-mix arises if an IA multiplexer is merging two or more IA sequences. In this case, it may choose to capture the loudness information from the original IA sequences in multiple sub-mixes, instead of recomputing the loudness information for the final mix.

<b>Syntax</b>
```
class mix_presentation_obu() {
  leb128() mix_presentation_id;
  mix_presentation_annotations();

  leb128() num_sub_mixes;
  for (i = 0; i < num_sub_mixes; i++) {	  
    leb128() num_audio_elements;
    for (j = 0; j < num_audio_elements; j++) {
      leb128() audio_element_id;

    }
  }
}  
```

<b>Semantics</b>

<dfn noexport>mix_presentation_annotations()</dfn> is a class that provides informational metadata that an IA parser should refer to when selecting the mix presentation to use. The metadata may also be used by the playback system to display information to the user, but is not used in the rendering or mixing process to generate the final output audio signal.


<dfn noexport>num_sub_mixes</dfn> specifies the number of sub-mixes.

<dfn noexport>num_audio_elements</dfn> shall specify the number of audio elements that are used in this mix presentation to generate the final output audio signal for playback.

<dfn value noexport for ="mix_presentation_obu()">audio_element_id</dfn> shall indicate the unique ID associated with a specific audio element that is used in this mix presentation.

<dfn noexport>num_layouts</dfn> specifies the number of layouts for this sub-mix which the loudness informations were measured on.

<dfn noexport>loudness_layout</dfn> identifies the layout that was used to measure the loudness information provided in this sub-mix.

<dfn noexport>loudness</dfn> provides the loudness information which was measured on [=loudness_layout=] for the mixed audio elements by this sub-mix.

The layout specified in [=loudness_layout=] should not be higher than the highest layout among layouts provided by the audio elements. In other words, rendering from an audio element with the highest layout to the [=loudness_layout=] should not require an upmix.

If one sub-mix of Mix Presentation OBU includes only one single scalable channel audio, then it shall comply with as follows:
- [=num_layouts=] shall be greater than or equal to [=num_layers=] specified in [=scalable_channel_layout_config()=] of Audio Element OBU for the [=audio_element_id=].
- The set of [=loudness_layout=]s shall include all of [=loudspeaker_layout=]s specified in the [=channel_audio_layer_config()=]s of Audio Element OBU for the [=audio_element_id=]. 

The highest [=loudness_layout=] specified in one sub-mix is the layout which was used for authoring the sub-mix.

```

<b>Semantics</b>

<dfn noexport>true_peak</dfn> specifies the true peak of the audio signal, specified in dBFS and measured according to [[!ITU1770-4]].

NOTE: [[!ITU1770-4]] adopts the convention of using the dBov unit for dBFS, where the RMS value of a full-scale square wave is 0 dBov. The same convention is adopted here.

### Parameter Block OBU Syntax and Semantics ### {#obu-parameterblock}

This section specifies the OBU payload of OBU_IA_Parameter_Block.

The metadata specified in this OBU defines the parameter values for an algorithm for an indicated duration, including any animation of the parameter values over this duration. The metadata shall be used in conjunction with a corresponding parameter definition and parameter data specification. The parameter definition shall be specified based on [=ParamDefinition()=]. The parameter data shall provide the values to apply in each parameter block. These shall be specified using the [=AnimatedParameterData()=] function template if parameter animation is supported.

<b>Syntax</b>

```
class parameter_block_obu() {
  leb128() parameter_id;
  leb128() duration;
  leb128() num_segments;

  param_definition_type = get_param_definition_type(parameter_id);

  for (i = 0; i < num_segments; i++) {
    if (constant_segment_interval == 0) {
      leb128() segment_interval;
    }

    if (param_definition_type == PARAMETER_DEFINITION_MIX_GAIN) {

    }
    if (param_definition_type == PARAMETER_DEFINITION_RECON_GAIN) {
      recon_gain_info_parameter_data();
    }
  }
}

<dfn noexport>num_segments</dfn> shall specify the number of different sets of parameter values specified in this parameter block, where each set describes a different segment of the timeline, contiguously.

<dfn noexport>constant_segment_interval</dfn> shall specify the interval of each segment, in the case where all segments except the last segment have equal intervals. If all segments except the last segment do not have equal intervals, the value of constant_segment_interval shall be set to 0. 

<dfn noexport>get_param_definition_type()</dfn> is a run-time function to get the parameter definition type mapped to the parameter_id. 

Audio Element OBU and/or Mix Presentation OBU is mapping a parameter_id to the parameter definition type. So, IA decoders can know the definition type mapped to the parameter_id.

<dfn noexport>segment_interval</dfn> shall specify the interval for the given segment.

Each value of [=duration=], [=constant_segment_interval=] and [=segment_interval=] shall be expressed as the number of ticks at the rate indicated by the time base specified in the corresponding parameter definition.

	- When [=CSI=] != 0, [=NS=] x [=CSI=] shall be equal to or greater than [=D=].
		- If [=NS=] x [=CSI=] > [=D=], the actual interval of the last segment shall be [=D=] - ([=NS=] - 1) x [=CSI=].
	- When [=CSI=] = 0, the summation of all [=SI=]s in this parameter block shall be equal to [=D=].

<dfn noexport>animation_type</dfn> specifies the type of animation applied to the parameter values in this parameter block.

<pre class = "def">
animation_type : Animation Type
       0       : STEP
       1       : LINEAR
       2       : BEZIER
</pre>

Classes that take [=animation_type=] as an input argument must use the <dfn noexport>AnimatedParameterData()</dfn> function template. The method of applying the animation is described in [[#processing-animated-params]].

```
template <class T>
class AnimatedParameterData(animation_type) {
  if (animation_type == STEP) {
    T start_point_value;
  }
  if (animation_type == LINEAR) {
    T start_point_value;
    T end_point_value;

    T start_point_value;
    T end_point_value;

This value is expressed as a fraction of the parameter segment interval with valid values in the range of 0 and 1, inclusively. A value equal to 0 or 1 shall indicate that this animation implements a linear Bezier curve, in which case control_point_value shall be ignored by the IA parser. It is stored as an 8-bit, unsigned, fixed-point value with 8 fractional bits (i.e. Q0.8 in [[!Q-Format]]).

#### Parameter Definition Syntax and Semantics #### {#parameter-definition}

Parameter definition classes shall inherit from the abstract <dfn noexport>ParamDefinition()</dfn> class. They may optionally further provide default parameter values, which are applied when there are no parameter blocks available.

<b>Syntax</b>

```
abstract class ParamDefinition() {
  leb128() parameter_id;
  leb128() time_base;
}
```

<b>Semantics</b>

<dfn value noexport for="ParamDefinition()">parameter_id</dfn> shall indicate the unique ID in an IA sequence for a given parameter.

The first 22 audio substreams in an IA sequence may use the OBU types OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID0 to OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID21, which have predefined audio substream IDs associated with them. This avoids the need to manually specify an [=audio_substream_id=].

[=audio_substream_id=] = 0 to [=audio_substream_id=] = 21 shall be assigned to Audio Frame OBUs with the OBU types OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID0 to OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID21, respectively. 

<b>Syntax</b>

```
class audio_frame_obu_with_no_id() {
  leb128() audio_substream_id;
  audio_frame_obu(audio_substream_id);
}
```

```
class audio_frame_obu(audio_substream_id) {
  unsigned int (8*coded_frame_size) audio_frame();
}
```

<b>Semantics</b>

<dfn noexport>audio_substream_id</dfn> shall indicate a unique ID in an IA sequence for a given substream. All Audio Frame OBUs of the same substream shall have the same audio_substream_id.

This value must be greater or equal to 22, in order to avoid collision with the reserved IDs for the OBU types OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID0 to OBU_IA_Audio_Frame_ID21.

<dfn noexport>coded_frame_size</dfn> is the size of [=audio_frame()=] in bytes.

<dfn noexport>audio_frame()</dfn> is the raw coded audio data for the frame. It shall be [=opus packet=] of [[!RFC6716]] for IAMF-OPUS, [=raw_data_block()=] of [[!AAC]] for IAMF-AAC-LC and [=FRAME=] of [[!FLAC]] for IAMF-FLAC.

For IAMF-LPCM, [=audio_frame()=] shall be LPCM samples. When more than one byte is used to represent a LPCM sample, the byte order shall be in little endian. 

For this version of the specification, all audio frames for a given substream must be gapless.

    unsigned int (1) reinitialize_decoder;
    unsigned int (6) reserved;
    sleb128() relative_offset;
  }
}
```

<b>Semantics</b>

<dfn noexport>global_offset</dfn> shall specify the offset that is applied to all substreams and parameters specified in this Sync OBU, in addition to their individual relative offsets.

For this version of the specification, the value of global_offset shall be set to 0.

<dfn noexport>num_obu_ids</dfn> shall specify the number of substream and parameter IDs that this Sync OBU specifies the offset for.

<dfn noexport>obu_id</dfn> shall specify the unique ID associated with the substream or parameter that is being referred to.

<pre class = "def">
obu_data_type : Type of OBU data
      0       : SUBSTREAM
      1       : PARAMETER
</pre>

<dfn noexport>reinitialize_decoder</dfn> shall be used to specify the behaviour of a decoder when encountering gaps in the audio substream, where the gap shall be identified as described in [[#standalone-synchronizing-data-obus]]. If obu_data_type does not equal SUBSTREAM, an IAMF-OBU parser shall ignore this field.

If reinitialize_decoder = 0, the decoder shall not be reinitialized before decoding the audio frames after the gap. This may be used in the case where it is preferable for the decoder to fill the gap with silence instead.

If reinitialize_decoder = 1, the decoder shall be reinitialized before decoding the audio frames after the gap. If a pre-skip is specified in the relevant Codec Config OBU, it is applicable after reinitializing the decoder.

For this version of the specification, the value of reinitialize_decoder shall be set to 0. If a value of 1 is seen, the IA sequence shall be rejected as invalid.

<dfn value noexport for="sync_obu()">reserved</dfn> shall be set to 0. Reserved units are for future use and shall be ignored by an IAMF-OBU parser.

<dfn noexport>relative_offset</dfn> is the offset to position the first audio frame (before trimming) or parameter block with the referenced obu_id that comes after this Sync OBU with respect to the timeline generated before this Sync OBU. If this Sync OBU is the first one, it is the offset from 0. Otherwise, it is the offset from the end of the timeline of Substreams generated from the previous Sync OBU.

The offset shall be indicated in the number of ticks at the time_base specified in the corresponding substream or parameter definition. 

IA encoder and decoder operations related to this field are specified in [[#standalone-synchronizing-data-obus]].

    unsigned int (6) output_gain_flag(i);
    unsigned int (2) reserved;
    signed int (16) output_gain(i);
  }
}
```

When an audio element is composed of G(r) number of substreams, scalable channel audio for the audio element shall be layered into [=num_layers=] = r number of ChannelGroups.

<center><figcaption>Immersive Audio Sequence with scalable channel audio (before OBU packing)</figcaption></center>

The IA decoder shall select one of one or more channel audios provided by scalable channel audio. The IA decoder should select the appropriate channel audio according to the following rules, in order:
- The IA decoder should first attempt to select the channel audio whose loudspeaker layout matches the physical playback layout.
- If there is no match, the IA decoder should select the channel audio with the closest specified loudspeaker layout to the physical layout and then apply up or down-mixing appropriately, after decoding and reconstruction of the channel audio. [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-downmixmechanism]] and [[#processing-downmixmatrix]] provide examples of dynamic and static down-mixing matrices for some common layouts that may be used.

#### ITU-R BS.2127 Direct Speakers Config Syntax and Semantics #### {#syntax-rendering-direct-speakers-config}

The metadata specified in itur_bs2127_direct_speakers_config(), based on [[!ITU2076-2]], provides information about the loudspeaker that is intended to be used for playing back each of the input audio channels. An IA renderer must use the DirectSpeakers rendering method of EAR, specified in [[!ITU2127-0]], in combination with these metadata to render to the output loudspeakers.

The position information is specified in polar coordinates following the convention of [[!ITU2076-2]]. Specifically,

- The origin is in the centre.
- The azimuth angles are expressed in degrees, with 0 degrees as straight ahead, and positive values rotating to the left (anti-clockwise) when viewed from above.
- The elevation angles are expressed in degrees, with 0 degrees horizontally ahead, and positive values going up.
- The distance is a normalized distance, where 1.0 is assumed to be the default radius of the sphere.

# Standalone IAMF Representation # {#standalone}

This section details the order in which the OBUs shall be sequenced in a standalone IAMF representation. It further specifies how the Data OBUs shall be synchronized, with the aid of the Sync OBUs.

## OBU Sequence Order ## {#standalone-obu-sequence-order}

An IA sequence is composed of a series of OBUs in the sequence of a set of descriptor OBUs followed by their associated data OBUs, and where this pattern is repeated as many times as needed.

### Descriptor OBUs ### {#standalone-descriptor-obus}
A set of Descriptor OBUs shall be placed at the beginning of the bitstream in the following order:

1. One Magic Code OBU
2. All Codec Config OBUs
3. All Audio Element OBUs
4. All Mix Presentation OBUs


### Data OBUs ### {#standalone-data-obus}

One Sync OBU shall be placed immediately after the Descriptor OBUs. This shall be followed by a sequence of Audio Frame OBUs, Parameter Block OBUs, one or more additional Sync OBUs and one or more Temporal Delimiter OBUs, according to the rules below:

- Audio Frame OBUs and Parameter Block OBUs must be ordered by their implied timestamp in the timeline, and may be interleaved.
- If there are multiple Audio Frame OBUs that have the same implied start timestamp, they must be grouped by audio elements.
- A new Sync OBU may be inserted anywhere in the sequence of data OBUs, as frequently as needed.
- Between two Sync OBUs, a sequence of audio frames or parameter blocks must be gapless.
- If an Audio Frame OBU or Parameter Block OBU has a substream or parameter ID that is not defined in the most recent Sync OBU, it must not appear in the bitstream, until a new Sync OBU is provided that specifies them.
- A Temporal Delimiter OBU may be inserted at the beginning of a temporal unit, defined as a set of all audio frames with the same start timestamp and the same duration from all substreams and all non-redundant parameter blocks with the start timestamp within the duration. A temporal unit may include redundant parameter blocks.
- If Temporal Delimiter OBUs are present, they must be inserted at the beginning of every temporal unit.

Additionally, the following constraints apply to the Audio Frame and Parameter Block OBUs:

- Audio Frame OBUs must be provided non-redundantly, such that for each substream, there shall not be two audio frames that are overlapping in time.
- Parameter Block OBUs may be provided redundantly, such that they contain the same data as a previously provided Parameter Block OBU for the same time region. In this case, the "obu_redundant_copy" field in the OBU header shall be set to 1.
- Redundant Parameter Block OBUs do not need to be ordered by their implied timestamp in the timeline. The implied timestamp should be inferred from the initial non-redundant version.
- Non-redundant Parameter Block OBUs must not provide data for overlapping time regions.

### Refreshing Descriptor OBUs ### {#standalone-obu-sequence-refreshes}

The above describes the full sequence of OBUs for a given set of descriptor OBUs and their associated data OBUs. If the IAMF configuration changes, a new set of descriptor OBUs is required. In that case, a new sequence of the complete set of descriptor OBUs, a Sync OBU and their corresponding data OBUs shall follow, in the same order as described above.

The descriptor OBUs may additionally be repeated redundantly and as frequently as necessary. In this case, the "obu_redundant_copy" field in the OBU header of each of the descriptor OBUs shall be set to 1.

If there is set of descriptor OBUs placed mid-stream, there may be parameter blocks that came before them which are still valid and applicable for the duration after the descriptor OBUs. In this case, these parameter blocks must be redundantly copied and placed after the first Sync OBU that follows the descriptor OBUs. This ensures that any receiver joining mid-stream and encountering a set of descriptor OBU is guaranteed to be able to receive the complete set of metadata that is applicable to all audio frames that come after.

## Synchronizing Data OBUs ## {#standalone-synchronizing-data-obus}

The audio frames and parameter data provided in the Data OBUs may be asynchronous; different audio substreams may have different audio frame sizes, parameter blocks may have different durations from the audio frames, or there may be gaps in a parameter's timeline. This section details how these Data OBUs may be synchronized, based on their duration and the information provided in the Sync OBUs.

The Sync OBU contains two pieces of information that apply to all substream and parameters that follow it: 

1) a relative offset for each of the substreams and parameters, and

2) a global offset.

The relative offsets describe how the substreams and parameters are positioned with respect to the timeline of Substreams generated from the previous Sync OBU. For example, from the previous Sync OBU, Substream 1 has a end timestamp 960 units, Substream 2 has a end timestamp 1024 units, Parameter 1 has a end timestamp 900 units and Parameter 2 has a end timestamp 1100 units. The relative offsets are calculated with respect to the maximum timeline of Substreams (i.e. 1024 units). So, Substream 1 has a relative offset that is 64 units before Substream 2, Substream 2 has  a relative offset that is 0 unit, Parameter 1 has a relative offset that is 124 units before Substream 2 and Parameter 2 has a relative offset that is 76 after Substream 2.

<table class="def">
<tr>
  <th>ID (name)</th><th>end timestamp</th><th>Relative offset</th>
</tr>
<tr>
  <td>N/A (Global offset)</td><td>0</td><td>0</td>
</td>
</tr>
  <td>1 (Substream 1)</td><td>960</td><td>-64</td>
</td>
</tr>
  <td>2 (Substream 2)</td><td>1024</td><td>+0</td>
</td>
</tr>
  <td>3 (Parameter 1)</td><td>900</td><td>-124</td>
</td>
</tr>
  <td>4 (Parameter 2)</td><td>1100</td><td>+76</td>
</tr>
</table>

The global offset defines an additional offset that is applied to all substreams and parameters, and can be used to express intentional gaps between the local frames associated with two Sync OBUs.

The local frame of reference can be positioned in a global frame of reference by using the concatenation rule provided below. This rule specify how two timelines associated with different Sync OBUs shall be aligned.

<dfn noexport>Concatenation Rule</dfn>

Ignoring the global offset, the new timeline after a Sync OBU is extended based on the timeline generated from the previous Sync OBU and relative offsets in the current Sync OBU. Then, the global offset is applied to additionally shift the new timeline.


The algorithm below may be used to implement the concatenation rule. But, the result shall comply with this.

```
For a given ID, end_timestamp\[ID]\[0] = 0 (i.e. initial value = 0)

Encoder operation for the Nth Sync OBU 
// Encoders know the position of an OBU on global timeline. 
// So, they know start_timestamp\[ID]\[N] and global_offset\[N].

For each ID in the Nth Sync OBU.

relative_offset\[ID]\[N] = start_timestamp\[ID]\[N] - global_offset\[N]
                           - max(end_timestamp\[ID]\[N-1] for each audio frame ID);
// i.e. relative_offset\[ID]\[1] = start_timestamp\[ID]\[1] 
//                                 - global_offset\[1] for the first Sync OBU.

// end_timestamp\[ID]\[N] for each ID is calculated as follows:

end_timestamp\[ID]\[N] = start_timestamp\[ID]\[N];

for (i = 0: i < M(N); i++) {
  end_timestamp\[ID]\[N] += frame size of ith audio frame
                            (or duration of ith parameter block) having the ID;
}
// M(N) is the number of audio frame OBUs(or parameter block OBUs) having the given ID
// between the Nth Sync OBU and the (N+1)th Sync OBU.

Decoder operation for the Nth Sync OBU 
// Decoders need to extend the timeline generated from the previous Sync OBU.
// For the first Sync OBU which decoders get after join mid-stream, N is set to 1.

For each ID in the Nth Sync OBU.

start_timestamp\[ID]\[N] = max(end_timestamp\[ID]\[N-1] for each audio frame ID)
                           + relative_offset\[ID]\[N] + global_offset\[N];

end_timestamp\[ID]\[N] = start_timestamp\[ID]\[N];

for (i = 0: i < M(N); i++) {
  end_timestamp\[ID]\[N] += frame size of ith audio frame
                            (or duration of ith parameter block) having the ID;
}
// M(N) is the number of audio frame OBUs
// (or parameter block OBUs) having the given ID
// between the Nth Sync OBU and the (N+1)th Sync OBU.
```

### Requirement of IA sequence ### {#isobmff-singletrack-iasequence}

IA sequence shall comply with the bitstream which is specified in [[#profiles-simple]] or [[#profiles-base]] for encapsulation of ISOBMFF with single track.


### Encapsulation Scheme ### {#isobmff-singletrack-basicencapsulationscheme}

During encapsulation process, OBUs of IA sequence are encapsulated into [[!ISOBMFF]] as follows:
- Magic Code OBU: version and profile version fields shall be moved to IASampleEntry.
- Codec Config OBU: 
	- codec_id and decoder_config() shall move to IASampleEntry.
	- num_samples_per_frame shall move to 'stts'.
	- roll_distance shall be stored as [=AudioPreRollEntry=] having [=grouping_type=], 'prol'.
- Mix Presentation OBUs and Audio Element OBUs (with OBU syntax) shall be stored as a new sample group having [=grouping_type=], [=iagd=].
- Sync OBU: parse the input timeline using the Sync OBU information and construct a PTRO box that describes the relative offsets for each parameter block.
- Each temporal unit:
	- Temporal Delimiter OBU: shall be discarded if present.
	- Parameter Block OBU for demixing_info_parameter_data() (with OBU syntax) shall be stored as a new sample group having [=grouping_type=], [=demi=].
	- Remained OBUs of each temporal unit shall be stored as one sample data without gap among OBUs.
- Audio Frame OBUs:
	- Select one substream. 
	- If [=obu_trimming_status_flag=] of the first Audio Frame OBU of the substream is set to 1, keep parsing following Audio Frame OBUs of the substream until meets the Audio Frame OBU having [=obu_trimming_status_flag=] =  0 and sum [=num_samples_to_trim_at_start=]. Then reflect the result of the summation to 'edts'.
	- If [=obu_trimming_status_flag=] of the last Audio Frame OBU of the substream is set to 1, then reflect num_samples_to_trim_at_end to 'stts.

# ISOBMFF IAMF Decapsulation # {#isobmff-decapsulation}

## ISOBMFF IAMF Decapsulation with single track ## {#isobmff-decapsulation-singletrack}

This section provides a guideline for IAMF parser to reconstruct IA sequences from IAMF file.

When IAMF parser feeds the reconstructed IA sequences to IAMF-OBU parser, descriptor OBUs shall be placed at the first and followed by Temoral Units.

<center><figcaption>IAMF Decapsulation Guideline</figcaption></center>


During decapsulation process, IAMF file is decapsulated into IA sequences which conform to [[#obu-syntax]] as follows:
- Step1: Reconstruction of descriptor OBUs (one Magic Code OBU, one Codec Config OBU, one or more Mix Presentation OBUs and one or more Audio Element OBUs) for the ith IA sequence.
	- [Step1-1] Magic Code OBU: take version and profile_version fields from <code>iamf</code> sample entry and packetize it with [=ia_code=] and the pre-fixed header value (i.e. 0xF006) by OBU.
	- [Step1-2] Codec Config OBU: generate [=codec_id=] and [=decoder_config()=] from CodecSpecificBox of <code>iamf</code> sample entry, num_samples_per_frame from 'stts' box and take roll_distance from [=AudioPreRollEntry=], and packetize it by OBU with obu_type = OBU_IA_Codec_Config.
	- [Step1-3] Mix Presentation OBUs and Audio Element OBUs: take the ith SampleGroupDescriptionEntry as it is in SampleGroup with grouping_type, [=iagd=].
	- [Step1-4] Figure out the offset (i1) and number (im) of Samples, which the ith SampleGroupDescriptionEntry is applied to, from the SampleGroup.
- Step2: Prepare Sync_OBU with obu_type = OBU_IA_Sync.
- Step3: Reconstructing of the jth Temporal Unit of the ith IA sequence (j = i1, i2, …, im)
	- [Step3-1] If there is the SampleGroup with grouping_type = [=demi=], then take the parameter block OBU for the demixing_info and jth sample. Otherwise, take jth sample as it is.
		- Parameter block OBU for demixing_info: take the SampleGroupDescriptionEntry as it is, from SampleGrouop with grouping_type = [=demi=], mapped to jth Sample.
	- [Step3-2] Place Sync_OBU at the front of the result of Step2-2 without gap to reconstruct the jth Temporal Unit.
- Step4: Place descriptor OBUs, followed by Sync OBU, and followed by Temporal Units in order (j = i1, i2, …, im) without gap, to reconstruct the ith IA sequence.

[=codec_id=] and [=decoder_config()=] for IAMF-OPUS is generated as follows:
- The syntax and values shall conform to [=ID Header=] of [[!RFC7845]] with following constraints.
	- [=OutputChannelCount=], [=PreSkip=], [=InputSampleRate=], [=OutputGain=] and [=ChannelMappingFamily=] are copied from [=dOps=] box.
	

[=codec_id=] and [=decoder_config()=] for IAMF-AAC-LC is generated as follows:
- [=codec_id=]: 'mp4a'
- [=decoder_config()=] is generated from [=DecoderConfigDescriptor()=] of [=esds=] box.

## Scalable Channel Audio decoding ## {#processing-scalablechannelaudio}

This section describes the decoding of Scalable Channel Audio.

Below figure shows the decoding flowchart of the decoding for Scalable Channel Audio.

<center><img src="images/Channel Audio Decoding Flowchart.png" style="width:80%; height:auto;"></center>
<center><figcaption>Scalable Channel Audio Decoding Flowchart</figcaption></center>

For a given loudspeaker layout (i.e. CL #i) among the list of [=loudspeaker_layout=] in scalable channel layout config,
- OBU Parser shall get substreams for ChannelGroup #1 ~ ChannelGroup #i and pass them to Codec decoder with [=Decoder_Config()=].
- Codec decoder shall output decoded channels (PCM) in the transmission order.
	- For non-scalable audio (i.e i = 1), its order shall be converted to the loudspeaker location order for CL #1.
- Following are further processed for scalable audio (i.e. i > 1)
	- When Output_Gain_Is_Present_Flag(j) for ChannelGroup #j (j = 1, 2, …, i-1) is on, Gain module shall apply Output_Gain(j) to all audio samples of the mixed channels in the ChannelGroup #j indicated by Output_Gain_Flag(j).
	- De-Mixer shall output de-mixed channels (PCM) for CL #i generated through de-mixing of the mixed channels from Gain module by using non-mixed channels and demixing parameters for each frame.
	- Recon_Gain module shall output smoothed channels (PCM) by applying Recon_Gain to each frame of the de-mixed channels.
	- The order for Non-mixed channels and Smoothed channels shall be converted to the loudspeaker location order for CL #i after going through necessary modules such as Gain, De-Mixer, Recon_Gain etc..
- Following may be further processed
	- Loudness normalization module may output loudness normalized channels at -24 LKFS from non-mixed channels and smoothed channels (if present) by using loudness value for CL #i.
	- DRC control module may apply the pre-defined DRC compression to the loudness normalized channels, after that it outputs loudness normalized channels at -16 LKFS.
	- Limiter module may limit the true peak of input channels at -1dB.

Following sections, [[#processing-scalablechannelaudio-gain]], [[#processing-scalablechannelaudio-demixer]] and [[#processing-scalablechannelaudio-recongain]] are only needed for decoding of scalable audio with [=num_layers=] > 1.

### Gain ### {#processing-scalablechannelaudio-gain}

Gain module is the mirror process of Attenuation module. It recovers the reduced sample values using Output_Gain when its flag for ChannelGroup #j is on. When its flag is off, then this module shall be bypassed for ChannelGroup #j. Output_Gain(j) for ChannelGroup #j shall be applied to all samples of the mixed channels in the ChannelGroup #j. Where, mixed channels means the mixed channels from an input channel audio (i.e. a channel audio for CL #n).

To apply the gain, an implementation MUST use the following:

```
	Sample *= pow(10, Output_Gain(j) / (20.0*256))
```

Where, Output_Gain(j) is the raw 16-bit value for jth layer which is specified in [=channel_audio_layer_config()=].

### De-mixer ### {#processing-scalablechannelaudio-demixer}

For scalable channel audio with [=num_layers=] > 1, some channels of [=down-mixed audio=] for CL #i are delivered as is but the rest are mixed with other channels for CL #i-1.

De-mixer module reconstructs the rest of the down-mixed audio for CL #i from the mixed channels, which is passed by Gain module, and its relevant non-mixed channels using its relevant demixing parameters.

De-mixing for down-mixed audio for CL #i shall comply with the result by the combination of following surround and top de-mixers:
- Surround de-mixers
	- <dfn noexport>S1to2 de-mixer</dfn>: R2 = 2 x Mono – L2
	- <dfn noexport>S2to3 de-mixer</dfn>: L3 = L2 – 0.707 x C and R3 = R2 – 0.707 x C
	- <dfn noexport>S3to5 de-mixer</dfn>: Ls = 1/δ(k) x (L3 – L5) and Rs = 1/δ(k) x (R3 – R5)
	- <dfn noexport>S5to7 de-mixer</dfn>: Lrs = 1/β(k) x (Ls – α(k) x Lss) and Rrs = 1/β(k) x (Rs – α(k) x Rss)
- Top de-mixers
	- <dfn noexport>TF2toT2 de-mixer</dfn>: Ltf2 = Ltf3 – w(k) x (L3 – L5) and Rtf2 = Rtf3 – w(k) x (R3 – R5)
	- <dfn noexport>T2to4 de-mixer</dfn>: Ltb = 1/γ(k) x (Ltf2 – Ltf4) and Rtb = 1/γ(k) x (Rtf2 – Rtf4)
- Where, Ltf2 / Rtf2 is top channel of x.1.2ch, Ltf3 / Rtf3 is top channel of 3.1.2ch, and Ltf4 / Rtf4 is to channel of x.1.4ch (x = 5 or 7) and w(k) is determined from the value of wIdx(k).

Initially, wIdx(0) = 0 and the value of wIdx(k) shall be derived as follows:
- <dfn noexport>wIdx(k)</dfn> = Clip3(0, 10, wIdx(k-1) + w_idx_offset(k))

Mapping of wIdx(k) to w(k) should be as follows:
<pre class = "def">
 wIdx(k) :   w(k)
    0    :    0
    1    :  0.0179
    2    :  0.0391
    3    :  0.0658
    4    :  0.1038
    5    :  0.25
    6    :  0.3962
    7    :  0.4342
    8    :  0.4609
    9    :  0.4821
    10    : 0.5
</pre>

When D_set = { x | S1 < x ≤ Si and x is an integer},
- If 2 is an element of D_set, the combination shall include [=S1to2 de-mixer=].
- If 3 is an element of D_set, the combination shall include [=S2to3 de-mixer=].
- If 5 is an element of D_set, the combination shall include [=S3to5 de-mixer=].
- If 7 is an element of D_set, the combination shall include [=S5to7 de-mixer=].

When Ti = 2,
- If Sj = 3 (j=1,2,…, i-1), the combination shall include [=TF2toT2 de-mixer=].

When Ti = 4,
- If Sj = 3 (j=1,2,…, i-1), the combination shall include [=TF2toT2 de-mixer=] and [=T2to4 de-mixer=].
- Elseif Tj = 2 (j=1,2,…, i-1), the combination shall include [=T2to4 de-mixer=].

For example, when CL #1 = 2ch, CL #2 = 3.1.2ch, CL #3 = 5.1.2ch and CL #4 = 7.1.4ch. To reconstruct the rest (i.e. Ls5/Rs5/Ltf/Rtf) of the down-mixed 5.1.2ch,
- The combination includes [=S2to3 de-mixer=], [=S3to5 de-mixer=] and [=TF2toF2 de-mixer].
- Ls5 and Rs5 are recovered by S2to3 de-mixer and S3to5 de-mixer.
- Ltf and Rtf are recovered by S2to3 de-mixer and TF2toT2 de-mixer.

```
	Ls5 = 1/δ(k) × (L2 - 0.707 × C - L5) and Rs5 = 1/δ(k) × (R2 - 0.707 × C - R5).
	Ltf = Ltf3 - w(k) x (L2 - 0.707 x C - L5) and Rtf = Rtf3 - w(k) x (R2 - 0.707 x C - R5).
```

### Recon Gain ### {#processing-scalablechannelaudio-recongain}

[=recon_gain=] shall be only applied to all of audio samples of the de-mixed channels from De-mixer module.
- [=recon_gain_info_parameter_data()=] indicates each channel of CL #i which Recon_Gain needs to be applied to and provides Recon_Gain value for each frame of the channel.
	- Sample (k,i) *= Smoothed_Recon_Gain (k,i), where k is the frame index and i is the sample index of the frame.
	- Smoothed_Recon_Gain (k) = MA_gain (k-1) x e_window + MA_gain (k) x s_window
	- MA_gain (k) = 2 / (N+1) x Recon_Gain (k) / 255 + (1 – 2/(N+1)) x MA_gain (k-1), where MA_gain (0) = 1.
	- e_window[:ps – olen] = 1, e_window[ps – olen: ps] = hanning[olen:], e_window[ps:flen] = 0.
	- s_window[:ps – olen] = 0, s_window[ps – olen: ps] = hanning[:olen], s_window[ps:flen] = 1.
	- Where, hanning = np.hanning (2*olen), ps is the pre-skip value, flen is the frame size and olen is the overlap size.
	- Recommend values: N = 7

Below figure shows the smoothing scheme of [=recon_gain=].

<center><img src="images/Smoothing Scheme of Recon Gain.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;"></center>
<center><figcaption>Smoothing Scheme of Recon Gain</figcaption></center>

Recommend values for specific codecs are as follows
- IAMF-OPUS: olen = 60, the pre-skip (ps) value is indicated in Codec_Specific_Info for IAMF-OPUS.
- IAMF-AAC-LC: olen = 64, ps = 720.

## Mix Presentation ## {#processing-mixpresentation}

An IA sequence may contain more than one mix presentation. [[#processing-mixpresentation-selection]] details how a mix presentation should be selected from multiple of them.

A mix presentation specifies how to render, process and mix one or more audio elements. Each audio element should first be individually rendered and processed before mixing. Then, any additional processing specified by [=output_mix_config()=] should be applied to the mixed audio signal in order to generate the final output audio for playback. [[#processing-mixpresentation-rendering]] details how each audio element should be rendered, while [[#processing-mixpresentation-mixing]] details how the audio elements should be processed and mixed.

### Selecting a Mix Presentation ### {#processing-mixpresentation-selection}

An IA sequence may contain more than one mix presentations. The IA parser should select the appropriate mix presentation in the following order.

1. If there are any user-selectable mixes, the IA parser should select the mix, or mixes, that match the user's preferences. An example might be a mix with a specific language. Mix presentations may use [=mix_presentation_friendly_label=] to describe such mixes.
2. If there are more than one valid mixes remaining, the IA parser should select an appropriate mix for rendering, in the following order.
	1. If the playback layout is binaural, i.e. headphones:
		1. Select the mix with [=audio_element_id=] whose [=loudspeaker_layout=] is BINAURAL.
		2. If there is no such mix, select the mix with the highest available [=loudness_layout=].
	2. If the playback layout is loudspeakers:
		1. If there is a mix with an [=loudness_layout=] that matches the playback loudspeaker layout, it should be selected. If there are more than one matching mixes, the first one should be selected.
		2. If there is no such mix, select the mix presentation with the highest available [=loudness_layout=].

### Rendering an Audio Element ### {#processing-mixpresentation-rendering}

This specification supports the rendering of either a multichannel or ambisonics audio element to either a target loudspeaker layout or a binaural output. The choice of the renderer to use when processing a mix presentation depends on the input audio element and the playback layout, as defined below and summarized in the following table.

After selecting a Mix Presentation, an audio element should be rendered as follows:
- If the audio element is a channel-based element, apply M2M-Rendering (M2M-Rendering: Multichannel to Multichannel Rendering).
- If the audio element is a scene-based audio element, apply A2M-Rendering (A2M-Rendering: Ambisonics to Multichannel Rendering).
	
For M2M-Rendering,
- The input layout of the IA renderer is set as follows:
	- If [=num_layers=] = 1, use the [=loudspeaker_layout=] of the audio element.
	- Else, if there is a [=loudness_layout=] that matches the playback layout, use it.
	- Else, use the next highest available layout from all available [=loudspeaker_layout=] and [=loudness_layout=].
- The output layout of the IA renderer is set to the playback layout.
- The IA renderer used is selected according to the following rules:
	- If the playback layout matches a [=loudspeaker_layout=] which can be generated from the highest loudspeaker layout of the audio element according to [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-channellayoutgenerationrule]], use demixing_info_parameter_data().
		- If demixing_info_parameter_data() is not delivered, use EAR Direct Speakers renderer ([[!ITU2127-0]]).
	- Else if the playback layout complies with loudspeaker layouts supported by [[!ITU2051-3]], use EAR Direct Speakers renderer ([[!ITU2127-0]]).
	- Else, use implementation-specific renderer.
 
For A2M-Rendering,
- The input layout of the IA renderer is set to Ambisonics.
- The output layout of the IA renderer is set to the playback layout.
- The IA renderer used is selected according to the following rules:
	- If the playback layout complies with loudspeaker layouts supported by [[!ITU2051-3]], use EAR HOA renderer ([[!ITU2127-0]]).
	- Else, use implementation-specific renderer.
		- If there is no implementation-specific Ambisonics renderer, use the EAR HOA renderer to render to the next highest [[!ITU2051-3]] layout compared to the playback layout, and then downmix using implementation-specific renderer.

For a given x.y.z layout, the next highest layout x'.y'.z' means that x', y' and z' are greater than or equal to x, y and z, respectively.

#### EAR Direct Speakers renderer #### {#processing-mixpresentation-rendering-ear-directspeakers}

In addition to the metadata provided in itur_bs2127_direct_speakers_config(), the IA renderer should provide the following to the EAR Direct Speakers renderer for each audio channel of the audio element:

- speaker label: the label of the speaker position, using the same convention as "SP Label" in [[!ITU2051-3]]. This is defined for each audio channel of the audio element based on the information from [=loudspeaker_layouts=].
- azimuth: specifies the azimuth location of the sound. This is mapped from the speaker label as defined in [[!ITU2051-3]].
- elevation: specifies the elevation location of the sound. This is mapped from the speaker label as defined in [[!ITU2051-3]].

In [[!ITU2051-3]], an LFE audio channel may be identified either by an explicit label or its frequency content. In this specification, the LFE channel is identified based on the explicit label only, given by [=loudspeaker_layout=].

#### EAR HOA renderer #### {#processing-mixpresentation-rendering-ear-hoa}

The IA renderer should provide the following metadata to the EAR HOA renderer for each audio channel:

1. Ambisonics order
2. Ambisonics degree
3. Ambisonics normalization method

In this specification, the AmbiX format is adopted, which uses SN3D normalization and ACN channel ordering. Accordingly, the Ambisonics order and degree can be computed from the channel index k as follows:

```
order   n = floor(sqrt(k)),
degree  m = k - n * (n + 1).
```

### Mixing Audio Elements ### {#processing-mixpresentation-mixing}

Each audio element is processed individually before mixing as follows:
1. Render to the playback layout.
2. If all audio elements do not have a common sample rate, re-sample to 48 kHz.
3. If all audio elements do not have a common bit-depth, convert to a common bit-depth. This specification recommends using 16 bits.
4. If [=loudness_layout=] matches with the playback layout, apply any per-element processing according to [=element_mix_config()=].

The rendered and processed audio elements are then summed, and then apply [=output_mix_config()=] to generate one sub-mixed audio signal. If there are more than one sub-mixes, the output of each sub-mix is further summed to generate the final mixed audio signal.


## Animated Parameters ## {#processing-animated-params}

This section describes how a set of parameters is animated over a segment in a parameter block, using the information provided in [=AnimatedParameterData()=].

Let P0, P1 and P2 be 2D coordinates defined as

```
P0 = (t_start, start_point_value),
P1 = (t_control, control_point_value),
P2 = (t_end, end_point_value),
```

where t_start is the segment start time, t_end is the segment end time and t_control is the control point time given by

```
t_control = t_start + (t_end - t_start) * control_point_relative_time.
```

If [=animation_type=] is equal to STEP, the parameter value provided by [=start_point_value=] should be applied immediately to all samples of the segment.

If [=animation_type=] is equal to LINEAR, the parameter value is linearly interpolated between [=start_point_value=] and [=end_point_value=] as follows:

```
B_linear(a) = (1 - a) * P0 + a * P2,
0 <= a <= 1.
```

If [=animation_type=] is equal to BEZIER, the parameter value is interpolated following a quadratic Bezier curve between [=start_point_value=] and [=end_point_value=] as follows:

```
B_quad(a) = (1 - a)^2 * P0 + 2 * (1 - a) * a * P1 + a^2 * P2,
0 <= a <= 1.
```

## Post Processing ## {#processing-post}

### Loudness Normalization ### {#processing-post-loudness}

Loudness normalization should be done by adjusting the loudness level to a target value, using the integrated loudness and true peak information provided in loudness_info(). If the true peak information is not available, the digital peak information should be used.

The rendered layouts that was used to measure the loudness information of a sub-mix are provided by [=loudness_layout=]s. 

If one of them matches the playback layout, the loudness information should be used directly for normalization. If there is a mismatch between [=loudness_layout=] and the playback layout, the implementation may choose to use the provided loudness information of the highest [=loudness_layout=] as-is. 

If there is more than one selected loudness_info() specified in the mix presentation (i.e. in case of multiple sub-mixes), the implementation should normalize the loudness of each sub-mix independently before summing them.

### Limiter ### {#processing-post-limiter}

The limiter should limit the true peak of audio signal at -1 dBTP, where true peak is defined in [[!ITU1770-4]]. The limiter should apply to multichannel signals in a linked manner and further support auto-release.


## Down-mix Matrix ## {#processing-downmixmatrix}


### Dynamic Down-mix Matrix {#processing-downmixmatrix-dynamic}

This section recommends dynamic down-mixing matrices.

The dynamix down-mixing matrics shall comply with the down-mixing mechanisam which is specified in [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-downmixmechanism]].


# IAMF Generation Process # {#iamfgeneration}

This section provides a guideline for IA encoding for a given input audio format.

Recommended input audio format for IA encoding is as follows:
- Ambisonics format: It shall conform to [=ChannelMappingFamily=] = 2 or 3 of [[RFC8486]].
- Channel Audio format: It shall conform to [=loudspeaker_layout=] specified in channel_audio_layer_config().
- Input Sampling Rate: 48000Hz
- Bitdepth: 16 bits or 24 bits
	- 16 bits are recommended for IAMF-OPUS.
- Input file format: .wav file (Linear PCM, simply called as PCM)

For a given input audio and user inputs, IA encoder shall output [=IA sequence=] which conforms to [[#obu-syntax]].

Input audio shall be one of followings:
- Ambisonics format
- Channel Audio format

User inputs are:
- Ambisonics mode to indicate if [=ChannelMappingFamily=] = 2 or 3 of [[RFC8486]].
- List of channel layouts to be supported for scalable channel audio: it shall conform to [=loudspeaker_layout=].
	- For a given input audio with Channel Audio format, if the input audio has height channels (e.g 7.1.4ch), each of the list of channel layouts should have height channels (i.e it should be higher than or equal to 3.1.2ch).
		- Examples for recommended list of channel layouts: 3.1.2ch/5.1.2ch, 3.1.2ch/5.1.2ch/7.1.4ch, 5.1.2ch/7.1.4ch etc..
		- Examples for not-recommended list of channel layouts: 2ch/3.1.2ch/5.1.2ch, 2ch/3.1.2ch/5.1.2ch/7.1.4ch, 2ch/5.1.2ch/7.1.4ch, 2ch/7.1.4ch etc..
		
NOTE: Contents providers may be satisfied with the down-mixed audio having no height channels even though the down-mix mechanism, specified in [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-downmixmechanism]], drops height channels when it does down-mix from input channel audio with height channels to surround channels for example from 7.14ch to Mono, Stereo, 5.1ch or 7.1ch. In that case, encoder may generate a scalable audio with the down-mixed audio without having height channels from the input channel audio with height channels. In other words, this specification does not disallow for scalable audios to have a down-mixed audio without having height channels from input channel auido having height channels.

IA encoding can be done by using the combination of following generation processing.
- Encoding of an audio element (Ambisonics encoding or Scalable Channel Audio encoding)

Following sections, [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-downmixparameter]], [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-downmixmechanism]], [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-channellayoutgenerationrule]], [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-recongaingeneration]] and [[#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-channelgroupgenerationrule]] do not needed for non-scalable channel audio (i.e., when [=num_layers=] specified in [=scalable_channel_layout_config()=] is set to 1).

### Down-mix parameter and Loudness ### {#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-downmixparameter}

This section describes how to generate down-mix parameters and loudness level for a given channel audio and a given list of channel layouts for scalability.

Below figure shows a block diagram for down-mix parameter and loudness module including down-mixer.

<center><img src="images/Down-mix Parameter and Loudness.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;"></center>
<center><figcaption>IA Down-mix Parameter and Loudness</figcaption></center>

For a given Channel Audio (e.g. 7.1.4ch) and a given list of channel layouts based on the Channel Audio,
- Down-mix parameter generator shall generate 5 down-mix parameters (α(k), β(k), γ(k), δ(k) and w(k)) by analyzing input Channel Audio, by referring [[AI-CAD-Mixing]]. Where, k is a frame index.
	- It is composed of Audio Scene Classification module and Height Energy Quantification module as depicted in Figure 11-2.
	- Audio Scene Classification module generates 4 parameters (α(k), β(k), γ(k), δ(k)) by classifying audio scenes of input channel audio in three modes.
		- Default scene: Neither Dialog nor Effect
		- Dialog scene: Center-channel oriented and clear dialog/voice sounds
		- Effect scene: Directional and spatially moving sounds.
	- Height Energy Quantification module generates a surround to height mixing parameter (w(k)) which is decided according to the relative energy difference between the top and surround channels of input channel audio.
		- If the energy of top channels is bigger than that of surround ones, then w_idx_offset(k) is set to 1. Otherwise, it is set to -1. And, w(k) is calculated based on w_idx_offset(k) and conforms to [[#processing-scalablechannelaudio]].
- Down-mixer generates down-mixed audios from input Channel Audio according to the list of channel layouts and the down-mix parameters, and outputs down-mixed audio for each channel layout to Loudness module.
	- It is not depicted in the figure but Down-mixer further generates [=Dmixp_Mode=] and [=Recon_Gains=] for each frame to be passed to OBU packetizer.
- Loudness module measures the loudness level ([=LKFS=]) of each down-mixed audio based on [[ITU1770-4]], and passes them to OBU packetizer.

### Down-mix Mechanism ### {#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-downmixmechanism}

This section specifies the down-mixing mechanism to generate <dfn noexport>down-mixed audio</dfn> for scalable channel audio.

For a given Channel Audio which conforms to [[=loudspeaker_layout]], the surround and top channels (if any) are separately down-mixed and especially step by step until to get a target channels.

Implementers may use another method to get the down-mixed audio from the given channel audio, but the down-mixed audio shall comply with that by this section.

Therefore, a down-mixer based on the down-mix mechanism is a combination of following surround down-mixer(s) and top down-mixer(s) as depicted in below figure.
- Surround Down-mixers: S7to5 enc., S5to3 enc., S3to2 enc., S2to1 enc.

```
	S7to5 enc.: Ls5 = α(k) x Lss7 + β(k) x Lrs7 and Rs5 = α(k) x Rss7 + β(k) x Rrs7.
	S5to3 enc.: L3 = L5 + δ(k) x Ls5 and R3 = R5 + δ(k) x Rs5
	S3to2 enc.: L2 = L3 + 0.707 x C and R2 = R3 + 0.707 x C
	S2to1 enc.: Mono = 0.5 x (L2 + R2)
```

- Top Down-mixers: T4to2 enc., T2toTF2 enc.

```
	T4to2 enc.: Ltf2 = Ltf4 + γ(k) x Ltb4  and Rtf2 = Rtf4 + γ(k) x Rtb4.
	T2toTF2 enc.: Ltf3 = Ltf2 + w(k) x δ(k) x Ls5 and Rtf3 = Rtf2 + w(k) x δ(k) x Rs5.
```

<center><img src="images/Down-mix Mechanism.png" style="width:100%; height:auto;"></center>
<center><figcaption>IA Down-mix Mechanism</figcaption></center>

```
For example, to get down-mixed 3.1.2ch from 7.1.4ch:
- S3 of 3.1.2ch is generated by using S7to5 and S5to3 encs.
- TF2 of 3.1.2ch is generated by using T4to2 and T2toTF2 encs.
```

### Channel Layout Generation Rule ### {#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-channellayoutgenerationrule}

This section describes the generation rule for channel layouts for scalable channel audio.

For a given channel layout (CL #n) of input Channel Audio, any list of CLs ({CL #i: i = 1, 2, ..., n}) for a scalable channel audio shall conform with following rules:
- Si ≤ Si+1 and Wi ≤ Wi+1 and Ti ≤ Ti+1 except Si = Si+1 and Wi = Wi+1 and Ti = Ti+1 for i = n-1, n-2, …, 1. Where ith Channel Layout CL #i = Si.Wi.Ti.
- CL #i is one of [=loudspeaker_layouts=] supported in this specification.

Down-mix paths, which conform to the above rule, shall be only allowed for scalable channel audio with [=num_layers=] > 1 as depicted in below figure.

<center><img src="images/Down-mix Path.png" style="width:90%; height:auto;"></center>
<center><figcaption>IA Down-mix Path</figcaption></center>

### Recon Gain Generation ### {#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-recongaingeneration}

This section describes how to generate [=recon_gain=].

Recon_Gain needs to be applied to de-mixed channels. For this, IA encoder needs to deliver it to IA decoders.

Let's define followings:
- Level Ok is the signal power for the frame #k of a channel of the down-mixed audio for CL #i.
- Level Mk is the signal power for the frame #k of the relevant mixed channel of the down-mixed audio for CL #i-1.
- Level Dk is the signal power for the frame #k of the de-mixed channel for CL #i (after demixing).

If 10*log10(level Ok / maxL^2) is less than the first threshold value (e.g. -80dB), Recon_Gain (k, i)  = 0. Where, maxL = 32767 for 16bits.

If 10*log10(level Ok / level Mk ) is less than the second threshold value (e.g. -6dB), Recon_Gain (k, i) is set to the value which makes level Ok = Recon_Gain (k, i)^2 x level Dk. Otherwise, Recon_Gain (k, i) = 1. Actual value to be delivered is floor(255*Recon_Gain).

```
For example, if we assume CL #i = 7.1.4ch and CL #i-1 = 5.1.2ch, then de-mixed channels are D_Lrs7, D_Rrs7, D_Ltb4 and D_Rtb4.
- D_Lrs7 and D_Rrs7 are de-mixed from Ls5 and Rs5 in the (i-1)th ChannelGroup by using Lss7 and Rss7 in the ith ChannelGroup and its relevant demixing parameters (i.e., α(k) and β(k)) , respectively.
- D_Ltb4 and D_Rtb4 are de-mixed from Ltf2 and Rtf2 in the (i-1)th ChannelGroup by using Ltf4 and Rtf4 in the ith ChannelGroup and its relevant demixing parameter (i.e., γ(k)), respectively.

Recon_Gain for D_Lrs7:
- Level Ok is the signal power for the frame #k of Lrs7 in the ith ChannelGroup.
- Level Mk is the signal power for the frame #k of Ls5 in the (i-1)th ChannelGroup.
- Level Dk is the signal power for the frame #k of D_Lrs7.
Recon_Gain for D_Rrs7:
- Level Ok is the signal power for the frame #k of Rrs7 in the ith ChannelGroup.
- Level Mk is the signal power for the frame #k of Rs5 in the (i-1)th ChannelGroup.
- Level Dk is the signal power for the frame #k of D_Rrs7.
Recon_Gain for D_Ltb4:
- Level Ok is the signal power for the frame #k of Ltf4 in the ith ChannelGroup.
- Level Mk is the signal power for the frame #k of Ltf2 in the (i-1)th ChannelGroup.
- Level Dk is the signal power for the frame #k of D_Ltb4.
Recon_Gain for D_Rtb4:
- Level Ok is the signal power for the frame #k of Rtf4 in the ith ChannelGroup.
- Level Mk is the signal power for the frame #k of Rtf2 in the (i-1)th ChannelGroup.
- Level Dk is the signal power for the frame #k of D_Rtb4.
```

### ChannelGroup Generation Rule ### {#iamfgeneration-scalablechannelaudio-channelgroupgenerationrule}

This section describes the generation rule for ChannelGroup.

For a given Channel Audio and the list of CLs ({CL #i: i = 1, 2, ..., n}), CG Generation module outputs the transformed audio (i.e. ChannelGroups) which shall conform to following rules:
- It consists of C number of channels and is structured to n number of CGs, where C is the number of channels for the Channel Audio.
- CG #1 (as called BCG): This CG is the down-mixed audio itself for CL #1 generated from the Channel Audio. It contains C1 number of channels.
- CG #i (as called DCG, i = 2, 3, …, n): This CG contains (Ci – Ci-1) number of channels. (Ci – Ci-1) channel(s) consists of as follows:
	- (Si – Si-1) surround channel(s) if Si > Si-1 . When S_set = { x | Si-1 < x ≤ Si and x is an integer},
		- If 2 is an element of S_set, the L2 channel is contained in this CG #i.
		- If 3 is an element of S_set, the Center channel is contained in this CG #i.
		- If 5 is an element of S_set, the L5 and R5 channels are contained in this CG #i.
		- If 7 is an element of S_set, the Lss7 and Rss7 channels are contained in this CG #i.
	- The LFE channel if Wi > Wi-1 .
	- (Ti – Ti-1) top channels if Ti > Ti-1 .
		- If Ti-1 = 0, the top channels of the down-mixed audio for CL #i are contained in this CG #i.
		- If Ti-1 = 2, the Ltf and Rtf channels of the down-mixed audio for CL #i are contained in this CG #i.

Below figure shows one example of transformation matrix with 4 CGs (2ch/3.1.2ch/5.1.2ch/7.1.4ch).

This section provide a guideline to generate element_mix_config().

An IA multiplexer may merge two or more IA sequences. In this case, it should adjust the gain values for [=element_mix_config()=]s as necessary to describe the desired relative gains between the IA sequences when they are summed to generate the final mix. It should also ensure that the gains selected do not result in clipping when the final mix is generated.

	- parameter_ids in Audio Element OBUs are updated to be unique in all of Audio Element OBUs.
- Mix Presentation OBUs: just take all of them and generate ones which are used after mixing of multiple audio elements if needed except following:
	- audio_element_ids in each Mix Presentation OBU are updated to indicate the [=audio_element_id=]s specified in Audio Element OBUs.

Step2: Data OBUs are generated as follows:
- Place Temporal Units from multiple audio elements in timing order.
	- [=obu_type=]s are updated to be aligned according to [=audio_substream_id=]s specified in Audio Element OBUs.
	- [=parameter_id=]s in Parameter Block OBUs are updated to be aligned according to parameter_ids in Audio Element OBUs.
- Add Sync OBU in front of Temporal Unit, frequently.
	- New Sync OBU is generated based on Sync OBUs from each IA sequence and updated [=audio_substream_id=]s and [=parameter_id=]s.
- It may have the immediately preceding temporal delimiter OBU for each audio element,

Step3: Generate IA sequence which starts descriptor OBUs and followed by Temporal Units in order.

# Annex A: Audio Substream Gaps

This annex describes a number of scenarios where a gap may exist in the audio signals, where a gap is defined as no audio frames for some period of time.

## A gap within an audio substream

A gap within an audio substream may be expressed via the Sync OBU offsets. A decoder encountering such a gap may either:

1. insert silent audio frames in the gap without reinitializing, or
2. reinitialize before decoding the audio frames after the gap.

The appropriate behaviour in this case is signalled via the [=reinitialize_decoder=] field in the Sync OBU.

In this version of the specification, gaps within an audio substream are not supported.

## A gap between two audio substreams

A gap may occur if there is a period of time between the end of one substream and the start of another. Such a gap may be expressed via the Sync OBU offsets. Similar to the case of a gap within an audio substream, the behaviour of the decoder is determined by the [=reinitialize_decoder=] field in the Sync OBU.

A gap may further occur if there is a period of time between the end of all substreams and the start of another. This case may be expressed by setting a non-zero value for the [=global_offset=] field in the Sync OBU.

## A gap due to packet loss

In the case where a gap is not signalled by the Sync OBUs, any unexpected absence of audio frames shall be interpreted as packet loss. The IAMF parser is unable to guarantee the correctness of following OBUs received until the next set of Descriptor OBUs.

In this version of the specification, gaps in the audio substreams are not supported so if a gap is encountered, it can always be interpreted as packet loss.

# Annex B: Short-lived Audio

An IA sequence may contain audio elements which are short-lived, where the audio element may not exist for the entire timeline of the IA sequence. There are two methods for signalling this. Consider the example with two audio elements, A and B, present at the start of the IA sequence, where B is a short-lived audio element with a length shorter than A.

1. The first method uses a new set of Descriptor OBUs. The first set of Descriptor OBUs includes an Audio Element OBU for each of A and B, and a Mix Presentation OBU that references both A and B. When the audio element B has ended, a second set of Descriptor OBUs is placed in the IA stream, which includes an Audio Element for only A, and a Mix Presentation OBU that references only A.

2. The second method uses Sync OBUs, without requiring a new Mix Presentation OBU. The Mix Presentation OBU contains an Audio Element OBU for each of A and B, and a Mix Presentation OBU that references both A and B. The first Sync OBU placed immediately after the Mix Presentation OBU includes both A and B. When the audio element B has ended, a new Sync OBU is placed in the IA stream which includes only A, indicating that B is no longer present in the timeline that comes immediately afterwards.

In both cases, relevant parameter blocks must be updated in a way to match the timing of the short-lived audio elements if necessary to ensure that the processed audio output is correct.
