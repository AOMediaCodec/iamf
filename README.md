Official specification of the AOM group for the Immersive Audio Model and Formats

The specification is written using a special syntax (mixing markup and markdown) 
to enable generation of cross-references, syntax highlighting, etc. The file
using this syntax is index.bs.

index.bs is processed to produce an HTML version (index.html) by a tool called
Bikeshed (https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed), which is run when content is
pushed onto the main branch or when Pull Requests are made.
